INTRODUCTION

The Truth & Beauty Lab Reservation System provides an easy to use dialog menu interface allowing visitors to book a reservation date, time, and destination or event. The owner can set individual schedules and prices for each destination or event. The reservation is booked when the reservation board receives payment equal to or greater than the price for the event. Notice of the reservation is sent to the owner via Instant Message and, if configured, Email. The visitor also receives an Instant Message and dialog informing them that their reservation has been booked. The Reservation System owner can configure the destination/event names, prices, default price, email address, hover text, board texture, dialog menu text, days of week to display, and times of day to display.
