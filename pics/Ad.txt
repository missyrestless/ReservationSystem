
I own a new magazine in SL and am looking for great designers that want to advertise their items, stores, businesses. 
Am giving out the oportunity for free advertising in the 1st volume, which is coming out soon, (end of March beginings of April). The magazine it's bilingual (English/Spanish) and your ad will be in both languages. 
After the 1st volume, the advertising will be charge for those designers that want to continue doing so. [Contact me to talk about the cost after 1st volume comes out if want to keep advertising]


Personally, I will give out magazines in many important spots, people will read it, guaranteed !!


When your ad is ready you will have the oportunity to see it & if needed, correct anything.

All I need from you is a notecard, please IM before you send it, sometimes I get so many I erase them before I take a look :P...



***The notecard needs to have: Store owners' name & (designers' names if apply), Locations, Blog ( If apply). An ad with the name of the store (LOGO) and a nice picture (could be high fashion or casual) but needs to be clear & presentable. Also I need a little description about your store & items.  If you have an exclussive item much better, and the date this item will be on stores :D. A very little but significant detail, name of the models in the picture, I would like to give credits to him/her/them.*** 



If you have any other friend/s that want to take this opportunity too, please tell them to contact me. Am usually online anytime from 12:00 PM SL time until 12:00 AM SL time. Please make sure your designer friend/s does nice things, not newbie stuffs haha. I'll appreciate it :D.

Hope to hear from you soon this week, thank you!!
